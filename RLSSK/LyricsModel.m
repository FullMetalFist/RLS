    How do you like to go up in a swing, \n \
    Up in the air so blue? \n \
    Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing \n \
    Ever a child can do! \n \
    Up in the air and over the wall, \n \
    Till I can see so wide, \n \
    Rivers and trees and cattle and all \n \
    Over the countryside— \n\n \
    Till I look down on the garden green, \n \
    Down on the roof so brown— \n \
    Up in the air I go flying again, \n \
    Up in the air and down! \n \
    How do you like to go up in a swing, \n \
    Up in the air so blue? \n \
    Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing \n \
    Ever a child can do!";

    I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,\n \
    And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.\n \
    He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;\n \
    And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.\n \
    \n\n \
    The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow—\n \
    Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;\n \
    For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,\n \
    And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.\n \
    \n\n \
    He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,\n \
    And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.\n \
    He stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see;\n \
    I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!\n \
    \n\n \
    One morning, very early, before the sun was up,\n \
    I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;\n \
    But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,\n \
    Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.\n";

    Faster than fairies, faster than witches,\n \
    Bridges and houses, hedges and ditches;\n \
    And charging along like troops in a battle\n \
    All through the meadows the horses and cattle:\n \
    All of the sights of the hill and the plain\n \
    Fly as thick as driving rain;\n \
    And ever again, in the wink of an eye,\n \
    Painted stations whistle by.\n \
    Here is a child who clambers and scrambles,\n \
    All by himself and gathering brambles;\n \
    Here is a tramp who stands and gazes;\n \
    And here is the green for stringing the daisies!\n \
    Here is a cart runaway in the road\n \
    Lumping along with man and load;\n \
    And here is a mill, and there is a river:\n \
    Each a glimpse and gone forever!";

    The moon has a face like the clock in the hall;\n \
    She shines on thieves on the garden wall,\n \
    On streets and fields and harbour quays,\n \
    And birdies asleep in the forks of the trees.\n \
    \n \
    The squalling cat and the squeaking mouse,\n \
    The howling dog by the door of the house,\n \
    The bat that lies in bed at noon,\n \
    All love to be out by the light of the moon.\n \
    \n \
    But all of the things that belong to the day\n \
    Cuddle to sleep to be out of her way;\n \
    And flowers and children close their eyes\n \
    Till up in the morning the sun shall arise.";

    Whenever the moon and stars are set,\n \
    Whenever the wind is high,\n \
    All night long in the dark and wet,\n \
    A man goes riding by.\n \
    Late in the night when the fires are out,\n \
    Why does he gallop and gallop about?\n \
    \n \
    Whenever the trees are crying aloud,\n \
    And ships are tossed at sea,\n \
    By, on the highway, low and loud,\n \
    By at the gallop goes he.\n \
    By at the gallop he goes, and then\n \
    By he comes back at the gallop again.";

    The sun is not a-bed, when I\n \
    At night upon my pillow lie;\n \
    Still round the earth his way he takes,\n \
    And morning after morning makes.\n \
    \n \
    While here at home, in shining day,\n \
    We round the sunny garden play,\n \
    Each little Indian sleepy-head\n \
    Is being kissed and put to bed.\n \
    \n \
    And when at eve I rise from tea,\n \
    Day dawns beyond the Atlantic Sea;\n \
    And all the children in the west\n \
    Are getting up and being dressed.";

    With trees on either hand.\n \
    \n \
    Green leaves a-floating,\n \
    Castles of the foam,\n \
    Boats of mine a-boating--\n \
    Where will all come home?\n \

    On goes the river\n \
    And out past the mill,\n \
    Away down the valley,\n \
    Away down the hill.\n \

    Away down the river,\n \
    A hundred miles or more,\n \
    Other little children \n \

    A blood-red orange, sets again.\n \
    \n \
    Before the stars have left the skies,\n \
    At morning in the dark I rise;\n \
    And shivering in my nakedness,\n \
    By the cold candle, bathe and dress.\n \
    \n \
    Close by the jolly fire I sit\n \
    To warm my frozen bones a bit;\n \
    Or with a reindeer-sled, explore\n \
    The colder countries round the door.\n \
    \n \
    When to go out, my nurse doth wrap\n \
    Me in my comforter and cap;\n \
    The cold wind burns my face, and blows\n \
    Its frosty pepper up my nose.\n \
    \n \
    Black are my steps on silver sod;\n \
    Thick blows my frosty breath abroad;\n \
    And tree and house, and hill and lake, \n \
    Are frosted like a wedding cake.";

    When I was sick and lay a-bed,\n \

    And all my toys beside me lay,\n \
    To keep me happy all the day.\n \
    \n \
    And sometimes for an hour or so\n \
    I watched my leaden soldiers go,\n \
    With different uniforms and drills,\n \
    Among the bed-clothes, through the hills;\n \
    \n \
    And sometimes sent my ships in fleets\n \
    All up and down among the sheets;\n \
    Or brought my trees and houses out,\n \
    And planted cities all about.\n \
    \n \
    I was the giant great and still\n \
    That sits upon the pillow-hill,\n \
    And sees before him, dale and plain, \n \
    The pleasant land of counterpane.";
